Happy that James mulched every inch of the ground and the beds, so the leaves of a few plants are looking a bit ropey, especially those close to the ground, but the root system should be nice and protected.

Who knows what fruit and veg we'll end up with this year!)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thursday 7th January","tags":"journal"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2021-01-07/"}}}
