In fact about a quarter of the potatoes were a smidge on the green side and we didn't want to risk it so we fed them to the worms.

Surprisingly everything is growing rather well! The companion plants are doing an okay job in keeping some pests away from our veggies, and we have butterflies and bees and hoverflies all over the place. The best flower by far is borage. I can't believe I had never heard of it before. Bees absolutely LOVE it. You can hear them from metres away, all over the borage flowers, it's my new favourite plant. I recommend every one get some for their gardens. I could sit for hours just listening to and watching the bees hopping from flower to flower. Not only that, but the seeds are food for wild birds, and once you have it, it'll self seed each year meaning you barely have to look after it, and the flowers and leaves are edible!

To...\" I didn't get a chance to finish the thought as I felt I had to go and help the bee which I found clinging to a book with a rainbow on it's cover. That's not really important for the story but it makes me wonder how the bee could confuse a flower with a picture of a rainbow on a book. Anyway, after a few seconds of removing all the books and trying to gently prompt this bee to fly away, careful not to scare it, it flew over towards the wide open window... but ended up bashing into the closed window next to it. Again, I gently wafted it out and eventually it made it back outside. I bet you're wondering where the epiphany is in all of this rambling. Well I went back to my journal to carry on where I left off, reading over the last sentence to remind me. \"What do I need to do???\" I asked myself. And I sighed and smiled, \"To treat myself like I would treat a lost bee\". To be gentle to myself, to step back and see the open window right next to where I'm banging my head against a closed one, to be kind to myself. It felt like a revelation, a mystical experience almost. Directly afterwards, as I was tidying the books away, I opened up a book called \"Where Silence is Praise\" by a Carthusian and just flipped it open to a random page. I don't know what caused me to do it, but I landed on the most beautful sentiment that just seemed to fit the situation so perfectly: "}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Why we suffer"}]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We are not fond of suffering, and, in one sense, we are right.
