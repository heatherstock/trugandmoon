No longer defined by home, or who my parents were, there were other possibilities on offer. Whatever I wanted. My imagination soared with the shift in light. Decades later it still holds true. You can do near anything you want to, be almost anybody you want, the rest of the world is asleep. Loosen your shackles. For an hour or two feel free. There is nothing holding you back. Dawn is an enchanted world behind a hidden door...\"</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Morning: How to make time. Allan Jenkins"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/morning/"}}}
