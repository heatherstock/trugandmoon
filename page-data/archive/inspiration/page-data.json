None of these things cost the earth, and the more you do them, the less you will need to spend at the weekend to have a \"good time\" before it's Monday and you have to start the dragging yourself through the week again.

Our minds will throw tantrums as we try to override the tendency we have to switch on the TV, or scroll social media. Our minds will say \"Oh you've had a hard day, you're too tired to go for a walk in the sun, or make yourself a smoothie, or create something... Just watch the tv...\". This is a natural, biological response, not a sign that you're a failure. To overcome this, we need to practice being present, in the here and now. Maybe you start by noticing that you weren't present when you automatically switched on the tv and sat down. That's progress! Noticing yourself not being present, is being present. Maybe next time you notice, you shut off the TV and do something else, anything else, it might be another one of your tendencies like napping, but it broke the first habit. Each time, just realising, that right now is a new moment, where we can do literally ANYTHING. And then doing literally anything. The point is that we're actively choosing what to do, not allowing autopilot to drive us.

I now use the extra hour for appointments, walking around town chatting to my favourite shop keepers, cooking and eating real food... And my work day flies by, I have so much extra energy in the afternoon I get twice as much work done and I even have energy after work to choose between exploring the countryside on my new bike, or building my skills outside of work, or writing, or just chilling with my husband. All of this, and I haven't got any extra hours in my day, I haven't sacrificed sleep, I've just started actually piloting my plane instead of living on autopilot.

In the morning when you wake up, practice it when you want to press snooze (even if you press snooze, noticing yourself doing that is progress!) Practice it when you're at work sipping your tea, really appreciate the moment you sip your tea, and then go back to work. Practice it picking the kids up from school, or when cooking, or when listening to Spotify. And then practice shaking it up, take the kids to get ice cream, buy a new ingredient to cook with, walk a different way home. The less we're on autopilot, the more time we have, and the more time we have, the more amazing things we can do instead of waiting for the weekend. ∎"}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/articles/summer2020/finding-purpose-1/"},"excerpt":"Finding your life's purpose and achieving \"work / life balance\" can generally be thought of as myths for most people.
