This is our first edition and we have had a lot of fun putting it together, building it with gatsby, improving our CSS skills, making it fully responsive and more.

(Can you believe I was once a 5am riser? And even earlier when I worked as a baker!) The inspiration for our resolution comes from Morning, by Allan Jenkins, of which you'll find a book review in this edition.
