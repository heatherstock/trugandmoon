This is such a great pose: it's one of the developmental stages an infant goes through when learning to stand and walk, and practicing it re-establishes those optimal neural pathways. Unfortunately, these neural pathways might be sluggish after a long period of disuse due to our 21st Century poor posture habits, but they're still there! You've just got to give them a bit of a poke to wake up – a bit like I'm doing to my glutes in the photo. Poor posture can lead to something called gluteal amnesia, which is exactly what it sounds like, our nervous system has \"forgotten\" that the glutes are supposed to be doing the heavy lifting of keeping our bodies upright, because the hamstrings have been picking up the slack for so long.

Although we tend to see the psoas talked about as a muscle at the front of the hip, that's only a very small part of it: it's more accurate to say the psoas is a back muscle that also hinges the hip. Another important role of the psoas is to stabilise the femoral head in the hip joint.
