It tends to be an anteriorly tilted pelvis - a fancy sounding way of saying poor posture, which is aflicting more and more people in the 21st Century, even if you exercise a lot. The reason being that the hamstrings attach to the bottom of the pelvis, and if the pelvis is titled, the hamstrings will be pulled on, over time they become like an overly stretched elastic band, weak and unable to stretch further or contract when we need them to, like when we want to touch our toes or for efficient energy tranfer when running for example.

Distinctly different from a typical yoga low lunge, this is based on how we develop the ability to stand upright as an infant, something we need to retrain our brain to do in order to override bad habits we've built over a lifetime. You may be thinking, \"well I can obviously stand up, so why do I need to retrain my brain?\" The answer is that our bodies are very adaptive, so when our glutes become weak, our other, less equipped muscles will pick up the slack, but it's not a great solution.

To strengthen the glutes we need to remind them to do their job, as you can see me doing in the photo, giving my left gluteus maximus a poke and reminding the muscles to engage. This engagement allows the pelvis to maintain a neutral position and begins retraining the brain to eventually do this without us having to consciously clench or poke our butt.
