Life ISN'T a rollercoaster.</p>\n<p>Now I've often said, both to myself, and embarrassingly, to other people, \"just like Ronan Keating says, life is a rollercoaster, just gotta ride it, you know? And like a rollercoaster, if you resist and tense up and push yourself back into the seat you aren't going to have as much fun as if you relaxed into the safety harness and leaned into the ride.\" <strong>Cringe</strong>. HOWEVER, this is genuinely good advice if I do say so myself. There is no point resisting or worrying about things that may or may not happen, you're just putting yourself through unnecessary pain. </p>\n<p>But after 21 years I've changed my mind. (Side note: 21 years!! I'm as shocked as you.) </p>\n<p>I was journalling about \"time abundance\" after reading an article by Arianna Huffington, who like me suffers from a \"time famine\" mindset, constantly rushing around with time running out. Time is an analogy for life I think; you could replace time with the word life in the previous sentence and it would have the same meaning. Anyway I had this really clear imagination of time, which seemed to be this gaseous fluid, and an almost jarring sense of haemorrhaging. And I was trying to stem the flow of this strange fluid, but it was just passing through my fingers and there was nothing I could do. A sort of mild panic accompanied the whole thing. </p>\n<p>But then I realised that that's what time is <em>supposed</em> to do. It's <em>meant</em> to flow continuously with no way of stopping it. What isn't supposed to happen is me running round trying to stop it or collect it or whatever I was trying to do in my mad vision. So I came up with a new analogy. </p>\n<p>Time, or life, is actually a river and we travel along in a little boat. Sometimes it goes super fast like river rapids and we have work hard not to be capsized; sometimes it goes slow and we can take a nap. But no matter how hard we try we cannot change the flow. We can panic and try and push back the water, but all that will do is distract us from focussing on the important things around us. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sorry Ronan Keating...","tags":"Spiritual"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/winter2020-21/time/"}}}
