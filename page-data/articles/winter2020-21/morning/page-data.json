No longer defined by home, or who my parents were, there were other possibilities on offer. Whatever I wanted. My imagination soared with the shift in light. Decades later it still holds true. You can do near anything you want to, be almost anybody you want, the rest of the world is asleep. Loosen your shackles. For an hour or two feel free. There is nothing holding you back. Dawn is an enchanted world behind a hidden door...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book is compiled of his dawn diaries for a whole year, interspersed with short interviews with other early risers. The same questions for each, such as what their morning rituals are and how they would sum up their thoughts on mornings in a hundred words or less, are answered with poems, or describing pre-dawn as a woman the interviewee would like to send flowers, or gems such as \"It's the world before mankind has fucked it up\". It's a lovely balance of those who find the morning romantic, to those who rise early to fish for a living and wish that there was a storm so they could sleep in like the \"comfortable people\". </p>\n<p>The diaries themselves aren't particularly rivetting; it's just a very normal man pottering about his life in the dark mostly, but that's also what makes the book so easy to enjoy. No showing off, no grand adventures to get your heart racing, or worse, to compare your own boring life to. Just everyday mundanity... which by all accounts is simultaneously mystical as well as mundane: \"Non-morning people people might roll their eyes if you use words like sacred or magical to describe this time of day. But it is sacred ... and magical\", and \"[I] find it joyful ... to wake in the dark - perhaps with half an hour before sunrise - gives me a sense of being granted more of the magic than I was originally allotted\" are answers from two different interviews. </p>\n<p>Finally, the book ends with scientific, philosophical and spiritual perspectives on dawn, a final convincing, should we require it. My New Year's resolution is to wake up in time to see the sunrise at the beach every day. To witness the magic of the ocean, the sun, the moon, the wind, all of it: to find the sacred in the mundane. Thank you, Allan Jenkins. </p>\n<p>Don't go back to sleep!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Morning: How to make time.
