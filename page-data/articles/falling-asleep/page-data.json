Make sure you are comfortable and at a pleasant temperature.\nStart by clenching the toes and then releasing. Then squeeze the foot muscles, the ankles, the calves, the thighs, releasing between each one, trying to clench them all separately. Of course, this is not completely possible, but concentrate at least on each part of the body in turn.\nThen the buttocks, the abs, the back, the chest… The upper arms, the forearms… clench and unclench the fists… the neck, the jaw, the forehead…\nAnd finally completely relax every muscle with a large sigh, breathe out all the tension and smile. Repeat the whole process three times (unless you start to drift off to sleep, just allow that to happen).\nOnce you have finished the process, imagine you are sinking into the mattress and that you even become part of the mattress. If you have a thought, just let it go, mattresses don’t have thoughts after all… If you have an itch, try to ignore it or gently scratch it, but return to your position as part of the mattress. Breathe slowly and naturally and wait patiently for sleep to come…\nNote: This might not work for everyone, but try it one day and see if it helps. Sometimes I find myself almost angry that it hasn’t worked, and the next second it seems I am waking up after a full night’s rest after I fell asleep midway through the thought of it not working.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A technique for falling asleep...","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/14b42/potatoes.jpg","srcSet":"/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/f836f/potatoes.jpg 200w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/2244e/potatoes.jpg 400w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/14b42/potatoes.jpg 800w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/47498/potatoes.jpg 1200w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/0e329/potatoes.jpg 1600w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/dafff/potatoes.jpg 3731w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/falling-asleep/"}}}
