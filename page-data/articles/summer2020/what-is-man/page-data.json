Is anything we do to be praised or admonished? Or is everything we do simply a result of our nature and our nuture? \"What is Man?\" seeks to answer these questions. Interestingly enough Mark Twain didn't publish it until many years after it was written, and even then in a tiny print run, anonymously. He was so afraid of the ideas within ruining his reputation and leaving him penniless. If that doesn't inspire you to read it, I don't know what will! </p>\n<p>We see from the introduction the principles, or dogmas, are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Man is a machine; he originates nothing, not even a thought. He is moved, directed, comanded, by external influences alone. </li>\n<li>All conduct arises from a single motive — self-satisfaction; the attainment of self-approval, Man must act to as to content the spirit within; he cannot do otherwise. </li>\n<li>The permanent unalterable thing in a human being is the temperament. Born with a man, the temperament remains with him to the end; he cannot change it. </li>\n<li>Complete determinism. Man is made by his heredity; the future, being fixed, is as irrevocable as the past. </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Am I honest?\" he asked [in a letter to his most intimate friend, the Rev. Joseph Twichell]. \"I give you my word of honour (privately) I am not. For seven years I have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me I ought to publish. I hold it a duty to publish it. There are other difficult duties I am equal to, but I am not equal to that one.\"</em></p>\n<p>Am I honest? I give you my word of honour (publicly) I am not. For several years I have suppressed a blog which my conscience tells me I ought to publish. I hold it a duty to publish it. There are other difficult duties I am equal to, but I am not equal to that one. Well, until now. I've finally come to a place in my life where I am motivated enough by external influences to content the spirit within and start writing a blog — or at least that is Mark Twain's theory. Maybe this was determined all along, that this moment right now I would be writing these very words and in a few minutes I will be publishing. Who knows? </p>\n<p>I'm working on Satya at the moment — truthfulness. Not many people are truthful. As long as we have fear, we cannot be truthful. Fear of people seeing behind the perfect mask we feel compelled to wear all of the time. Fear of that leading to us losing something, our job, our friends, our spouses. I'm not simply talking about \"not lying to people\" like we tell young children, I'm talking about that deeper level of truth, of deciding what we stand for and speaking up about it. Even though I am not truthful, I am more aware of being not truthful, and maybe one day I will even be truthful, like Mark Twain. ∎</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is Man?
