It's the hottest day of the year so far and we are finally starting to feel at home in Bexhill now that lockdown is easing and we're spending lots more time sitting outside cafes having coffee and croissants (and beer, depending on the time of day!)

Enjoy :) </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Summer 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/welcome/"}}}
