To...\" I didn't get a chance to finish the thought as I felt I had to go and help the bee which I found clinging to a book with a rainbow on it's cover. That's not really important for the story but it makes me wonder how the bee could confuse a flower with a picture of a rainbow on a book.

Again, I gently wafted it out and eventually it made it back outside. I bet you're wondering where the epiphany is in all of this rambling. Well I went back to my journal to carry on where I left off, reading over the last sentence to remind me. \"What do I need to do???\" I asked myself. And I sighed and smiled, \"To treat myself like I would treat a lost bee\". To be gently to myself, to step back and see the open window right next to where I'm banging my head against a closed one, to be kind to myself. It felt like a revelation, a mystical experience almost. Directly afterwards I opened up a book that I removed from the shelf to free the bee called \"Where Silence is Praise\" by a Carthusian, and just flipped it open to a random page. I don't know what caused me to do it, but I landed on the most beautful sentiment that just seemed to fit the situation so perfectly: </p>\n<p>On suffering</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The bee in the bookshelf","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/14b42/potatoes.jpg","srcSet":"/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/f836f/potatoes.jpg 200w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/2244e/potatoes.jpg 400w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/14b42/potatoes.jpg 800w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/47498/potatoes.jpg 1200w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/0e329/potatoes.jpg 1600w,\n/static/342903be077b518e8b5d3a1e73b6675d/dafff/potatoes.jpg 3731w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/bee-bookshelf/"}}}
