In fact about a quarter of the potatoes were a smidge on the green side and we didn't want to risk it so we fed them to the worms.

Surprisingly everything is growing rather well! The companion plants are doing an okay job in keeping some pests away from our veggies, and we have butterflies and bees and hoverflies all over the place. The best flower by far is borage. I can't believe I had never heard of it before. Bees absolutely LOVE it. You can hear them from metres away, all over the borage flowers, it's my new favourite plant. I recommend every one get some for their gardens. I could sit for hours just listening to and watching the bees hopping from flower to flower. Not only that, but the seeds are food for wild birds, and once you have it, it'll self seed each year meaning you barely have to look after it, and the flowers and leaves are edible!
