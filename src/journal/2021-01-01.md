A walk to the beach at dawn to see the sunrise. Coffee in a flask. The most beautiful ocean I have ever seen, as always (or as my Dad never hesitates to remind me, "it's not the ocean, it's The Channel". "Yes Dad, it's still part of the ocean." I believe he is jealous of our glorious seaside life. As he should be.)
