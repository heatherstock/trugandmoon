The first frost. Happy that James mulched every inch of the ground and the beds, so the leaves of a few plants are looking a bit ropey, especially those close to the ground, but the root system should be nice and protected. We don't have that much winter structure yet, but the black stained wood of the vegetable beds and the new growth on the artichokes looks magicial (we had a very strange autumn where I think a lot of the plants thought it was spring again and started growing. Who knows what fruit and veg we'll end up with this year!)
