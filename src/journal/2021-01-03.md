I saw a premonition of our life to come: a blackbird pecking away at someone's beautiful ripening cherries. After some googling I'm unsure why there were cherries at this time of year, so maybe they just *looked* like cherries. Anyway, the premonition is still valid, we shall have to wait and see whether the catnip we plan to grow under the cherry trees does enough to keep the birds away.
