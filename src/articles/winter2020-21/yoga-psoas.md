Another look at the LYT method low lunge, which you may recognise from my piece on why we need to strengthen the [hamstrings (summer 2020 edition)](https://trugandmoon.com/articles/summer2020/yoga-hamstrings/). This is such a great pose: it's one of the developmental stages an infant goes through when learning to stand and walk, and practicing it re-establishes those optimal neural pathways. Unfortunately, these neural pathways might be sluggish after a long period of disuse due to our 21st Century poor posture habits, but they're still there! You've just got to give them a bit of a poke to wake up â€“ a bit like I'm doing to my glutes in the photo. Poor posture can lead to something called gluteal amnesia, which is exactly what it sounds like, our nervous system has "forgotten" that the glutes are supposed to be doing the heavy lifting of keeping our bodies upright, because the hamstrings have been picking up the slack for so long. 

What's this got to do with the psoas, you might be asking yourself. Well, if we have an anteriorly tilted pelvis, which most of us do, then not only are the hamstrings over-stretched, over-worked and weakened, but many other muscles are affected too! 

The psoas keep our spine upright when we're walking and also flex the hip, either lifting the leg or lifting the torso (i.e. from a supine to sitting position). They have a large connection at the lower spine, traverse the gut to wrap around the front of the hip and connect to the back of the inner side of the femur, sort of like a rope and pulley, with the hip as the fulcrum. Although we tend to see the psoas talked about as a muscle at the front of the hip, that's only a very small part of it: it's more accurate to say the psoas is a back muscle that also hinges the hip. Another important role of the psoas is to stabilise the femoral head in the hip joint.
