Welcome to the Summer 2020 edition of Trug & Moon! It's the hottest day of the year so far and we are finally starting to feel at home in Bexhill now that lockdown is easing and we're spending lots more time sitting outside cafes having coffee and croissants (and beer, depending on the time of day!) This is our first edition and we have had a lot of fun putting it together, building it with gatsby, improving our CSS skills, making it fully responsive and more. Enjoy :)
