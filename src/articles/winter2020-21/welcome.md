Welcome to the Winter 2020-21 edition of Trug & Moon. It's the first day of a brand new year, and boy are we glad. We gave the champers a miss last night and got an early-ish night in preparation for our New Year's Resolution: waking up every day in time to see the sunrise at the beach.  Admittedly it meant getting up at the rather reasonable hour of 7am, but that's still a good hour and a half earlier than we've managed for the vast majority of 2020. (Can you believe I was once a 5am riser? And even earlier when I worked as a baker!) The inspiration for our resolution comes from Morning, by Allan Jenkins, of which you'll find a book review in this edition. Enjoy :)
