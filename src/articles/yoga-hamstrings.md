In Progress... Lorem ipsum Slugs, aphids, ants, caterpillars, woodlice and what we can only assume was a giant fox poo - we've seen a lot in our attempts to grow some food for ourselves over the lockdown period. Our runner beans barely saw the light of day before being decimated by an unknown pest, leaving no evidence we even planted any, after spending weeks tending to the seedlings on the windowsill. The broadbeans have just been covered in aphids, which are tended to by a colony of ants that take them "home" at night to protect them and bring them back again the next morning so they have a never ending supply of "honeydew", aka aphid waste products. A beautifully disgusting example of symbiosis. We have managed to avoid too many slugs and caterpillers on our cabbages and kales, and the woodlice tend to hide in the lettuce rather than eat it, so hopefully *touch wood* that remains the case. I won't go into too many details about the fox poo other than it was ginormous but I can't think what other animals are roaming around a night time going to the toilet in asparagus beds.
