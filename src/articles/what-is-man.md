"But Stock..." Drayson will spontaneously ask me, usually when I am in the middle of something demanding, to which I will divert my concentration to look at him as he continues "... what is man?" Cue me losing my sh*t for about a second until I remember that I love him and his ability to take the seriousness out of situations, and I will laugh and playfully attack him.

We found the book in a charity shop, which are my favourite type of bookshops as the offerings are not determined by what's fashionable, and so you find such a bizarre collection of books you would never normally be exposed to. Well I should say Drayson found the book, which he only bought because it was letterpress printed and set in Baskerville, his favourite typeface (at the moment). And it was smelly, which seems to be his first  determinant when choosing books. 

Anyway, I finally got around to reading it and I was pleasantly surpised to find it was based around the concept of free will, something I've been exploring recently. 

I'll give a brief synopsis of each chapter, with notable quotes, followed by my own thoughts in _italics._ 

Chapter 1 - Man the Machine
